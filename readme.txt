this will be my first commit 

before starting go to main mern directory and do this
npm init -y 
this will initialise the package.json file 

then install all the required modules by

npm install mongoose dotenv express

put the repetitive scirpts such as 
nodemon backend/server.js to the "dev" part in 'scripts' in package.json file and then you can do 
npm run dev

npm i nodemon -D 
so that everytime something changes it refreshes automatically
